# MATLAB-codes_and_utilities_for_beginners
Folder containing some code to show beginners some interesting functions of Matlab.



I used a series of codes to introduce novice programmers to using and discovering the great features of Matlab.

In particular, I took inspiration from some nice codes on the internet, to show that the program can be used for multiple purposes: from creating simple drawings to complex 3D animations, to creating renders of pre-established images whose characteristics can be changed through modifications to the original code, up to more statistical, economic and financial uses.
